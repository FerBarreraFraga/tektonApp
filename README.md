HI!

The App I had to made it in a rush, I felt sick and had some thing to do at work and quickly in a night I found the time to make it.

I need yet to clean thwe code, I have some styles looking messy, but hope you can  understand the code :D

Also The "Product List" page was meant for the other way to filter the products but didnt had the time to finish it so I made a filter input instead.

Looking forward to hear your feedback!
